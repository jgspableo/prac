This repository documents my hands-on progress through the IBM DevOps and Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificates. Currently, the codebase focuses on engineering fundamentals, including Linux shell scripting (Bash), Python automation, and responsive web development with JavaScript. As I advance through the curriculum, I will integrate modules on containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-native architecture. This project serves as a living portfolio of my technical growth from core scripting to mastering the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
